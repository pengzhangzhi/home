## About Me

I'm Zhangzhi Peng (彭张智), a BME Ph.D. student at Duke University, trained as a computer scientist. Preferred to be called Zhangzhi, Fred, or "Hey dude". I advocate for open science and open source, striving to democratize knowledge for all.  I'm broadly interested in machine learning and protein design. Questions I'm thinking about:

<!-- ## Research Interests -->

- **Bridging the Gap Between Representation Learning and Generative Modeling**: 
  - "What I cannot create, I do not understand." This quote by Richard Feynman encapsulates that **Representation Learning and Generative Modeling** are the two sides of the same coin. But how exactly do we transform one into the other? 

- **How to design binders to a target from sequence alone?** 
  - Structure-based protein design has been the star of the show. But what about sequence-based design? Sequences encode the complete blueprint of a protein and thus, in theory, should be on par with their structure-based counterparts. Yet, the chasm is vast. How to fill in the gap?

- **The third dimension of protein language models(pLMs).** 
  - pLMs is reaching a plateau, with model sizes and training corpora stretching their limits. What lies beyond? A more efficient architecture or a deeper integration of biological context.
