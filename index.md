## About Me

Hey there! I’m Fred, a third-year Ph.D. student at Duke University. I have broad interests in machine learning and its applications in life science. I work with [Anru](https://anruzhang.github.io/) on statistical machine learning, [Alex](https://www.alextong.net/) on generative models, [Chris](https://christian.dallago.us/) on ML4Bio. My research aims to scale up the math on GPUs and see what wonderful things emerge.

I love coding and science. At the end of the day, what makes me happy isn’t publishing a paper. It’s making solid contributions that actually move the field forward — whether that’s a tool, a model, an equation, or a line of code that makes your life easier. I believe science should be accessible to everyone, and open-source is how I try to make that real - peep the goods on my [GitHub](https://github.com/pengzhangzhi). 

**“I spent my 2024 on protein language models, 2025 on diffusion language models, and will bet my 2026 on normalizing flows.”**


Long-term problems I'm pursuing:
<!-- ## Research Interests -->

- **Generative Models**
-  **Protein Design** 



## News

- **[Aug. 2025]** Interned with the ByteDance-Seed AI-for-Science team.
- **[Oct. 2024]** NSF Travel Award for CIKM 2024.
- **[Oct. 2024]** Duke BME Travel Award for BMES 2024.

## Misc
 - None of my work would be possible without the amazing brains I work with, [Chengtong Wang](https://github.com/Wangchentong), [Zachary W Bezemek](https://scholars.duke.edu/person/zachary.bezemek/research) etc. 
 - In my spare time, I run, play tennis, surf, and ski. Besides sports, I like watching loss go down and the diffusion sampling process.
 - I care about education equality and try to spend the rest of my spare time making science and knowledge more open.
