## About Me

Hey there! I'm Fred, a Ph.D. student at [Chatterjee Lab](https://www.chatterjeelab.com/), BME, Duke University. I'm interested in machine learning with applications in protein design. Long-term problems I'm pursuing:
<!-- ## Research Interests -->

- **Generative Models** (Continuous and Discrete Diffusion)
- **Protein Language Models (pLMs).** 
- **Protein Design** (motif-scaffolding, binder design)



## News

- **[Oct. 2024]** NSF Travel Award for CIKM 2024.
- **[Oct. 2024]** Duke BME Travel Award for BMES 2024.

## Misc
 - None of my work would be possible without the amazing brains I work with, [Alex Tong](https://www.alextong.net/), [Chengtong Wang](https://github.com/Wangchentong), etc. 
 - I maintain my [CV of Failure](pages/cv_of_failure.md), which many find to be encouraging.
 - I like to think about [puzzles](pages/pages/puzzles.md) from my research when I'm off sciencing.
