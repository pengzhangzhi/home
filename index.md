## About Me

Hey there! I'm Zhangzhi/Fred, a BME Ph.D. student at [Chatterjee Lab](https://www.chatterjeelab.com/), Duke University. I'm broadly interested in machine learning and protein design. Questions I'm thinking about:

<!-- ## Research Interests -->

- **Generative Models for Protein Design**: 
  - Efficient generation, binder design, and compositional generation.
- **The third dimension of protein language models(pLMs).** 
  - pLMs is reaching a plateau, with model sizes and training corpora stretching their limits. What lies beyond? A more efficient architecture or a deeper integration of biological context.


## News

- **[Oct. 2024]** NSF Travel Award for CIKM 2024.
- **[Oct. 2024]** Duke BME Travel Award for BMES 2024.
