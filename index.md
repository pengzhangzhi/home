## About Me

Hey there! I'm Fred/Zhangzhi, a Ph.D. student at [Chatterjee Lab](https://www.chatterjeelab.com/), BME, Duke University. I'm broadly interested in machine learning and protein design. Long-term problems I'm pursuing:
<!-- ## Research Interests -->

- **Generative Models**: 
  - Efficient generation, compositional generation, diffusion models for optimization.
- **The third dimension of protein language models(pLMs).** 
  - pLMs is reaching a plateau, with model sizes and training corpora stretching their limits. What lies beyond? A more efficient architecture or a deeper integration of biological context.
- **Protein Design**
  - Binder generation for therapeutics, Optimizing existing proteins.

## Misc

 - I maintain my [CV of Failure](pages/cv_of_failure.md), which many find to be encouraging.
 - I like to think about [puzzles](pages/pages/puzzles.md) from my research when I'm off sciencing.
