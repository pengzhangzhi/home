## About Me

Hey there! I'm Fred, a third-year Ph.D. student at Duke University. I'm interested in machine learning with applications in life science. 
I work with [Anru](https://anruzhang.github.io/) on statistical machine learning, [Alex](https://www.alextong.net/) on generative models, and [Pranam](https://www.chatterjeelab.com/) on protein design. 
Long-term problems I'm pursuing:
<!-- ## Research Interests -->

- **Generative Models**
-  **Protein Design** 
- **Discrete Diffusion Models** (or the hype name diffusion large langauge models)
- **Protein Language Models (pLMs).** 



## News

- **[Oct. 2024]** NSF Travel Award for CIKM 2024.
- **[Oct. 2024]** Duke BME Travel Award for BMES 2024.
- **[Aug. 2025]** Interned with the ByteDance-Seed AI-for-Science team.

## Misc
 - None of my work would be possible without the amazing brains I work with, [Chengtong Wang](https://github.com/Wangchentong), [Zachary W Bezemek](https://scholars.duke.edu/person/zachary.bezemek/research) etc. 
 - I like boxing, running, swimming, hooping, surfing, skiing etc. Besides sports, I like watching loss go down and the diffusion sampling process.
 - I care about education equality and try to spend the rest of my spare time making science and knowledge more open.
