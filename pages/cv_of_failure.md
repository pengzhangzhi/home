## CV of Failure
The CV of failure is motivated by [JOHANNES HAUSHOFER](https://crlte.engin.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/05/Johannes_Haushofer_CV_of_Failures.pdf). I keep track of them just to entertain/encourage my friends. I've lost track of my pre-PhD failures, which, in summary, are just a bunch of rejections from graduate schools, conferences, and journals.
